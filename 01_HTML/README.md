## 🧩 Core Principles Covered

### 1. HTML Document Anatomy

Understanding mandatory structural tags:

* `<html>`
* `<head>`
* `<body>`

This is non-optional knowledge.

### 2. Semantic HTML5

Using elements **based on meaning**, not appearance:

* `<article>`
* `<section>`
* `<aside>`
* `<nav>`

Semantics exist for browsers, screen readers, search engines, and future maintainability.

### 3. Metadata & SEO Basics

Proper use of:

* `<title>`
* `<meta charset>`
* `<meta name="description">`

SEO starts at the HTML layer.

### 4. Content Structuring

Correct usage of:

* Lists
* Tables
* Images
* Hyperlinks

Structure before styling. Always.

### 5. Form Fundamentals

Capturing user input with:

* `<form>`
* `<label>`
* `<input>`

Accessibility and clarity matter more than visuals.

### 6. Accessibility (A11y) First

Baseline rules:

* Always use `alt` on images
* Always bind labels using `for` and `id`

Accessibility is not optional. It’s engineering hygiene.

## 🖥️ How to Run & View

HTML runs directly in the browser. No build step. No excuses.

### Open in Browser

1. Right-click any `.html` file (e.g., `01_Basic_Document_Structure.html`)
2. Select **Open with** → Chrome / Firefox / Edge

### View Source

* Press `F12` for Developer Tools
* Or right-click → **View Page Source**

Read the code. Don’t just look at the output.

## 💻 Tools Used

| Tool              | Purpose          | Why It Matters                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 VS Code        | Code editor      | Are you using **Live Server**? If not, you’re slowing yourself down unnecessarily. |
| 🌐 Modern Browser | HTML interpreter | The browser *is* the compiler. Master its dev tools early.                         |
| 🐙 Git & GitHub   | Version control  | Commit **why** the file exists, not just **what** you typed.                       |

## 🔰 Tips for Beginners (Intellectual Sparring)

* **HTML is not a programming language**
  It does not implement logic. It structures information. Confusing this is a rookie mistake.

* **Validate your HTML**
  Use the W3C Markup Validation Service regularly. Browsers are forgiving; standards are not.

* **Semantics over aesthetics**
  Ignore how things look. Focus on what they *are*. CSS comes later.

* **Document flow matters**
  HTML is rendered top to bottom. This linear flow underpins everything in frontend engineering.

Truth beats convenience. Every time.
